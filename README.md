# Simulator for different fair queueing strategies

The goal is testing different strategies of fair queueing when packets of different flows arrive at a single output queue (or virtual output queue) of a switch. Among possible fair queueing strategies, only bit-by-bit GPS, Round-Robin (RR), and Deficit Round-Robin (DRR) are tested here.
